Objectives :
   The goal is to learn the proper way of creating an IT project following best practices. 

As an example of programming language, we will use JavaScript with its server-side runtime - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It is one of the most popular languages for developing various types of applications, and it's very easy to get started with.

## Prerequisites


Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. Install an **IDE or a text editor**, for example, [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install **Git**, use for installation:
  - Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
  - Linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux
  - macOS: https://git-scm.com/download/mac   
3. Install **Node.js**: https://nodejs.org/
4. Open a command-line interface:
  - macOS or Linux: use **Terminal**
  - Windows: use **Git Bash** (should be installed when installing Git). **Note!** Don't use default *CMD.exe*, because it has different commands from a command line of the Linux OS, which is used in most IT environments.



## Using

Follow these steps:
```
Go to cd ~/path/to/your-root-project-directory
Run the NPM script with the command: npm run start
Tap the following URL in google to access the web app https://localhost:3000/
